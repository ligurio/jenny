jenny: a dimension must have at least 2 features, not 1
jenny: 2-tuples are impossible with only 1 dimensions
jenny: something was trailing a dimension number

jenny:
  Given a set of feature dimensions and withouts, produce tests
  covering all n-tuples of features where all features come from
  different dimensions.  For example (=, <, >, <=, >=, !=) is a
  dimension with 6 features.  The type of the left-hand argument is
  another dimension.  Dimensions are numbered 1..65535, in the order
  they are listed.  Features are implicitly named a..z, A..Z.
   3 Dimensions are given by the number of features in that dimension.
  -h prints out these instructions.
  -n specifies the n in n-tuple.  The default is 2 (meaning pairs).
  -w gives withouts.  -w1b4ab says that combining the second feature
     of the first dimension with the first or second feature of the
     fourth dimension is disallowed.
  -ofoo.txt reads old jenny testcases from file foo.txt and extends them.

  The output is a testcase per line, one feature per dimension per
  testcase, followed by the list of all allowed tuples that jenny could
  not reach.

  Example: jenny -n3 3 2 2 -w2b3b 5 3 -w1c3b4ace5ac 8 2 2 3 2
  This gives ten dimensions, asks that for any three dimensions all
  combinations of features (one feature per dimension) be covered,
  plus it asks that certain combinations of features
  (like (1c,3b,4c,5c)) not be covered.

jenny: '-' by itself isn't a proper argument.
jenny: -n should give an integer in 1..32, for example, -n2.
jenny: -n says all n-tuples should be covered.
jenny: -n says all n-tuples should be covered.
jenny: -n should be followed by just an integer
jenny: -n, 19-tuples are impossible with only 5 dimensions
jenny: -w, dimension 4 was given twice in a single without
jenny: -w, dimension 25740329352 does not exist, you gave only 4 dimensions
jenny: -w, unexpected without syntax
jenny: proper withouts look like -w2a1bc99a
jenny: -w, withouts must follow numbers with features
jenny: -w, there is no feature 'f' in dimension 2
jenny: -w, dimension 0 does not exist, you gave only 4 dimensions
jenny: -w is <number><features><number><features>...
jenny: -w must start with an integer (1 to #dimensions)
jenny: -w, dimension 3 was given twice in a single without
jenny: -w, dimension 345 does not exist, you gave only 4 dimensions
jenny: -s should give just an integer, example -s123
jenny: -s must be followed by a positive integer
jenny: legal arguments are numbers, -n, -s, -w, -h, not -m
jenny: legal arguments are numbers, -n, -s, -w, -h, not -3
jenny: 2-tuples are impossible with only 0 dimensions
jenny: -o, non-space found where space expected
jenny: -o, non-number found where number expected
jenny: -o, non-space found where space expected
