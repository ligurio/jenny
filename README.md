### Jenny

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ligurio/jenny.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ligurio/jenny)

jenny is tool for generating regression tests. Any time exhaustive testing
looks painful due to the combinatorial explosion of features interactions to be
tested, consider using jenny. It will cover most of the interactions with far
fewer testcases. It can guarantee pairwise testing of all features that can be
used together, and it can avoid those feature combinations that cannot.
