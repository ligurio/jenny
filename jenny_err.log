jenny: 2-tuples are impossible with only 0 dimensions

./jenny a b c
jenny: 2-tuples are impossible with only 0 dimensions

./jenny 1
jenny: a dimension must have at least 2 features, not 1

./jenny 2
jenny: 2-tuples are impossible with only 1 dimensions

./jenny 2a 2b 2c
jenny: something was trailing a dimension number

./jenny -n3 52 53
jenny: dimensions must be smaller than 52.  53 is too big.

./jenny -n3 53 52 52
jenny: dimensions must be smaller than 52.  53 is too big.

./jenny -n3 52 52
jenny: -n, 3-tuples are impossible with only 2 dimensions

./jenny -n3 2 2 2 -h
jenny:
  Given a set of feature dimensions and withouts, produce tests
  covering all n-tuples of features where all features come from
  different dimensions.  For example (=, <, >, <=, >=, !=) is a
  dimension with 6 features.  The type of the left-hand argument is
  another dimension.  Dimensions are numbered 1..65535, in the order
  they are listed.  Features are implicitly named a..z, A..Z.
   3 Dimensions are given by the number of features in that dimension.
  -h prints out these instructions.
  -n specifies the n in n-tuple.  The default is 2 (meaning pairs).
  -w gives withouts.  -w1b4ab says that combining the second feature
     of the first dimension with the first or second feature of the
     fourth dimension is disallowed.
  -ofoo.txt reads old jenny testcases from file foo.txt and extends them.

  The output is a testcase per line, one feature per dimension per
  testcase, followed by the list of all allowed tuples that jenny could
  not reach.

  Example: jenny -n3 3 2 2 -w2b3b 5 3 -w1c3b4ace5ac 8 2 2 3 2
  This gives ten dimensions, asks that for any three dimensions all
  combinations of features (one feature per dimension) be covered,
  plus it asks that certain combinations of features
  (like (1c,3b,4c,5c)) not be covered.


./jenny -
jenny: '-' by itself isn't a proper argument.

./jenny -nb
jenny: -n should give an integer in 1..32, for example, -n2.

./jenny -n0
jenny: -n says all n-tuples should be covered.

./jenny -n33
jenny: -n says all n-tuples should be covered.

./jenny -n3a
jenny: -n should be followed by just an integer

./jenny -n19 2 3 4 5 6
jenny: -n, 19-tuples are impossible with only 5 dimensions

./jenny -n2 -w4b1a2dac4a 2 4 2 2

jenny: -w, dimension -29474424 does not exist, you gave only 4 dimensions

./jenny -n4 3 3 3 3 -w2-1za
jenny: -w, unexpected without syntax
jenny: proper withouts look like -w2a1bc99a

./jenny -n4 3 3 3 3 -w2
jenny: -w, withouts must follow numbers with features

./jenny -n4 3 3 3 3 -w2f

./jenny -n4 3 3 3 3 -w0a2b
jenny: -w, dimension 0 does not exist, you gave only 4 dimensions

./jenny -n4 3 3 3 3 -wn3a4b
jenny: -w is <number><features><number><features>...
jenny: -w must start with an integer (1 to #dimensions)

jenny: -w, dimension 3 was given twice in a single without

./jenny -n4 3 3 3 3 -w1a2b345

./jenny -s2 2 2 2 -s1a
jenny: -s should give just an integer, example -s123
